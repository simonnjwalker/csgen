# csgen
A helper for building C# projects and generating clean code

# history
0.01 Hello World uploaded to github

0.09 Functionally have search-replace and nth-item replace

0.10 Added an insert text to a particular line function

0.11 Fixed error with replacenth where index out-of-range



# Wishlist
I want this to be able to:
1 - do simple search-replace tasks in local files so that I can ditch replace.vbs
2 - do code generation for controllers/models so that I can use MVMVC-style coding with a facade (which I like for personal preference).
3 - do code generation with a consistent CapiTaliSation system (lowercase for viewmodels and controller actions, Titlecase for data objects, UPPERCASE for SQL, hungarianCase for models)
4 - generate views using Bootstrap 5 (ideally without jQuery)
5 - script this to automate the creation of MVC websites
6 - Help integrate Identity so that a funtional, data-driven website with pretty Bootstrap can be built and functionally work locally in a single script
7 - Run this on the Windows CLI


# Some caveats

This is not intended to replace MS commands like: dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc yq.Data.ApplicationDbContext -sqlite
